## ArchaicSeeker2.0
ArchaicSeeker is a series of software for detecting archaic introgression sequences and reconstructing introgression history. The latest version of this series, ArchaicSeeker 2.0, has the following three notable improvements compared with the original version of this software. First, it can automatically determine the boundary of each introgressed sequence. Next, it is capable of tracing both known and unknown ancestral sources of a given introgressed sequence. Finally, it has the ability to reconstruct the introgression history with more sophisticated introgression models.

The usage of ArchaicSeeker 2.0 can be found in Manual for ArchaicSeeker 2.0.pdf.

#### Updateï¼š
2022.09: We add the pipeline to identify the archaic allele which can be found in the folder "ArchaicAllele". For detailed algorithms, you can refer to the methods in AS2 NC paper.

2022.11: We add the archaic introgressed segments in East Asian, West Eurasian, South Asian, and Papuan detected by AS2, which can be found in the folder "IntrogressedSeg".

2025.08: Fixed a bug in Seeker.cpp

#### Correction to the protocol:
The statement in the top of page 4 (the reference allele in the input VCF files should be same as that of ancestral allele states) should be "the reference allele in the input VCF files should be same as that of reference genome".
